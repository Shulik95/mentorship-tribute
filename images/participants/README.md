# Participant Images

This directory contains profile images for program participants.

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Size**: Recommended 400x400px minimum
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) for best results
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for optimal loading

## Naming Convention

Images should be named using the participant's ID number:
- `1.jpg` - for participant with id: 1
- `2.png` - for participant with id: 2
- `3.webp` - for participant with id: 3

## Fallback Behavior

If an image file doesn't exist or fails to load, the system will automatically fall back to displaying the participant's initials with a gradient background.

## Supported File Extensions

- `.jpg` / `.jpeg`
- `.png` 
- `.webp`

The system will automatically try these extensions in order when looking for participant images.
